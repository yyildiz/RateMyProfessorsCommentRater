<h1>RateMyProfessors.com Comment Rating Script</h1> 

While trying to find more information about my professors for next semester I came across a minor flaw on ratemyprofessors.com's comment rating system. 
When you click to upvote or downvote a comment and refresh a page you can vote again and every single one of your votes are counted. 
This is just a fun little python script that exploits this flaw.
